This program does the following:
-Print a start-up message to stdout stating the
name of the executable, the time the program is
executed and the name of the input file the program
is run on
-Open the input file and a pipe to a child process.
In case of failure trying to open either of the two,
the program exits  
-Read the input file line by line
-Check if the first string/token/word in each
line matches up with one of the six keywords in
the "little" language for graphics
-As soon as the program finds a match, it delegates
the line processing acitivity to a function
specifically written to accomplish that goal. This
is how comments and image information get printed to
stdout, image information are added to the memory
storage, image drawing and child commands are sent
to Sketchpad via the child process and image
coordinates are translated
-Repeat the above three steps until the program
reaches the end of the file
-Close the input file and terminate the child preocess

(see draw2.c comments for more detail)

Compile by typing make.

Ensure an input file (e.g., inputfile.4) is present in
the current directory, and run by typing

./draw2 ./inputfile.4

where inputfile.4 is a text file containg valid input for draw2.c.

I did not collaborate with anyone. However, I received valuable
guidance from the course instructor and lab TAs.
