Assignment 2

Total: 92/100
TA Comments: 
The main function is too long and make the logic hard to trace. Better use more smaller functions to do simpler things seperately. 

CORRECTNESS

Total marks: 66/70

1. Handles an arbitrary number of images 9/10
2. Handles an arbitrary number of lines within an image 10/10
3. Handles redefining an image 5/5
4. Images can be rotated 10/10
5. Handles blank line in input file 3/3

STYLE

Total marks: 26/30

Modularization: 13/15
* Code is broken into modules 10/10
* Modules are chosen reasonably 3/5
  (ie. not too many, not too few, logical grouping of related functions)

Code Quality: 12/15
* Checks return values of system calls (fopen, fscanf)
* Simple solutions over complex solutions
* No unnecessarily inefficient algorithms
* Compiles without warnings
* Minimizes global variable use
* Functions do one thing
* Readable code (indentation, naming, comments, etc)
* Includes student info header in each file
* README file has description & instructions

DEDUCTIONS: 
- 30% (30 marks) if memwatch is not set up properly
- zero overall if does not compile
