This program does the following:
-Print a start-up message to stdout stating the
name of the executable, the time the program is
executed and the name of the input file the program
is run on 
-Read an input file line by line
-Check if the first string/token/word in each
line matches up with one of the eight keywords in
the "little" language for graphics
-As soon as the program finds a match, it 
increments the count for the corresponding keyword 
by one
-Repeat the above three steps until the program
reaches the end of the file
-Print to stdout the statistics of count for each
of the eight keywords in the input file

(see draw1a.c comments for more detail)

Compile by typing make.

Ensure an input file inputfile.1 is presnet in the current directory, and run by typing

./draw1a ./inputfile.1

where inputfile.1 is a text file containg valid input for draw1a.c.

I did not collaborate with anyone.
