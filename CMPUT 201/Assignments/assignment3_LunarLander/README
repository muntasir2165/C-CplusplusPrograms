This program does the following:
-Check if the user has provided the correct number of arguments
-Process the input by assigning the gravity and thruster values to the
 corresponding variables and the landscape file name to a character array.
-Try to open the landscape file and a pipe to the Sketchpad executable. If
 either fails, print an error message and quit the program.
 -Draw the landscape by sending drawSegment commands to Sketchpad.
-Set the curses to take user input when the game starts.
-Initialize the lander at the centre of the Sketchpad window.
-Print a message to the console stdout asking the player to press any key to
 start the game in the popped up sketchpad window.
-The player can press left and right arrow keys to move the lunar lander in
 the corresponding direction. Pressing the spacebar key initiates the thruster
 and pressing 'q' quits the game.
-If the player lands the lander at a reasonably slow speed AND on a flat
 surface, then the lunar lands successfully and a 'LANDED!!!' message is
 displayed on the console. Otherwise, the lander crashes and a message saying
 so is displayed to the stdout.
-No matter what the outcome of the game is, pressing 'q' at this point will
 get the player out of the game.
-Close the landscape input file, terminate the child process, unset the curses
 and exit the program

(see lander.c, functions.c and lander.h comments for more details)

Compile by typing make.

Ensure a landscape file (e.g., landscape.txt) is present in
 the current directory, and run by typing

./lander -g X -t Y -f landscape.txt

where:
	-lander is the executable
	-'-g' is the flag for gravity and X following it is gravity's nemerical
	  value (please note that X is expected to be a positive number)
	-'-t' is the flag for the lander's thrust and Y following it is thrust's
	 value (please note that Y is expected to be a negative number)
	-'f' is the flag for the landscape file to read (x,y) coordinates from and
	 landscape.txt following it is the name of the text file. The point
	 inside this file will be joined together to produce the landscape in
	 Sketchpad

I did not collaborate with anyone. However, I received valuable guidance from
 the course instructor and lab TAs.

 Small improvement with respect to the given lander executable:
 1) Accept the six arguments following './lander' in any order
