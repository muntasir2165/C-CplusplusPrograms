Design:

Phase 1:
--------
1) Read in the command line arguments
	-check that we have the right number of arguments
	-if possible, try to implement a version where the order of the arguments don't matter
	as long as they are preceded by the appropriate flag
2) Assign the read arguments to the appropriate variables
3) Put the read in points from the landscape.txt file into a structure image array (or not!) to be passed to Sketchpad for drawing the landscape
4) Draw the lunar module
	-place the module in the top middle of the Sketchpad window
5) Implement functions that simulate the lunar lander falling
6) Implement the time functionality in the program by incorporating specific functions
7) Write code such that the program is responsive to keyboard inputs...start with spacebar and 'q' input
8) Implement lunar rotation functionality into the program
9) Try to simulate the game such that it mirrors the given executable
10)
