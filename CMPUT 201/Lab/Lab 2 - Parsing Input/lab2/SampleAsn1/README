Sample Assignment 1 code.  Only similar in file structure, and, when
run with online input file, on output produced to sketchpad.

draw1.c and draw1.h code are incorrect.

Compile by typing make.

Run by typing ./draw1 ./inputfile.1

Note, as this is just an example, the input file in this case doesn't
matter; it will always produce the same output.

When coding, for example for your Assignment 1, you must ensure your
code properly uses the specified input file.
