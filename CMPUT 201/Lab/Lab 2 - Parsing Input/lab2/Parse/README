Does the following (see parse.c comment for more details)

  Read from input file (1st col.)             Convert to this (2nd col.)
  ==============================              =========================
  CLEARScreen                                 clearScreen
  Pause n                                     pause n_r
  END                                         end
  DRAWSegment x1 y1 x2 y2                     drawSegment x1_r y1_r x2_r y2_r

Compile by typing make.

Ensure an executable sketchpad.jar in the current directory, and run by
typing

./parse ./input_file

where input_file is a text file containg valid input for parse.c.

I did not collaborate with anyone.
